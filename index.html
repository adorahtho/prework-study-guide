        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS applies to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet can be added to the head element with the (style) element and only applies to that webpage. One change will apply to all identified (id) elements with the same "class" attribute.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style is using external CSS Style Sheet to keep all CSS rules seperate and easily change styles if needed. The external CSS Style Sheet can be linked inside the HTML head tag to apply changes to the webpage.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
