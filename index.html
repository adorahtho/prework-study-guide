          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Child elements are nested under the parent element.</li>
          <li>HTML elements contain an opening and closing tag.</li>
          <li>There are 6 total levels of headings ranging from large, "h1", to small, "h6", that should be used in order from h1 to h6. "h1" should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>There are 2 different types of lists (li), unordered lists and ordered lists. The item listed is nested under the parents element/type of list. (ul and ol) </li>
          <li>Image elements contain various attributes, but the main one is source. (src)</li>
          <li>The line break element is used to create empty space between elements. (br)</li>
          <li>The anchor element is used for creating links to the same or different webpage. (a)</li>
          <li>The section element is used to organize and seperate different parts of the page.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside 
            of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content 
            inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS applies to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet can be added to the head element with the 
            (style) element and only applies to that webpage. One change will 
            apply to all identified (id) elements with the same "class" attribute.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style is using external CSS Style Sheet 
            to keep all CSS rules seperate and easily change styles if needed. 
            The external CSS Style Sheet can be linked inside the HTML head tag 
            to apply changes to the webpage.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, 
            or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we 
            want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

            <li>Chrome DevTools is used to demonstrate how console.log works and 
              to confirm that the script tag added to index.html properly connects

              item in the array.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a 
              task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block 
              to be executed over and over.</li>
