# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to develop notes that I will actually refer to when needed. I built this project to learn how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This helps solve the problem of taking notes so I won't have to memorize everything.While creating this study guide, I learned about the basics of HTML, how to use CSS for styling, make the webpage a litte more interactive using JavaScript, and the workflow using Git.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide will be used to provide information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each topic is divided into it's own section. Information about each topic is found in bullet points below the topic title. The second header found under the cat picture at the top of the page instructs the user to "Open the Console to See What's Happening". To do this, you would right click on the page and navigate to DevTools console where JavaScript is running and will choose a topic for us to study first.
